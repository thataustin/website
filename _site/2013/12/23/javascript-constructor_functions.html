<p>My goal isn’t to teach about Javascript Prototypes, that’s been done. I want to give my opinion on how to use them.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what they are…I’ll do 2 things for us:</p>

<ol>
<li>Refer you to a link: http://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/02/22/a-plain-english-guide-to-javascript-prototypes/
<ul>
<li>This is the best article I’ve seen on it</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>I give you a <strong>brief</strong> synopsis of that link in case the URL ever changes:</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>

<p>You inherit from other objects by doing this:</p>

<p>~~~ var Student = {school: “The Institution}; var greg = {age: 34}; greg.__proto__ = Student;</p>

<p>greg.school == “The Institution”;</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>Voila, you have created an object <code>greg</code> whose prototype chain includes an object <code>Student</code> such that any reference to attributes not assigned directly to greg (eg, <code>school</code>) will be searched for in <code>Students</code> because it’s part of <code>greg</code>s prototype chain.</p>

<p>There are other, better ways to do this (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>) since <strong>proto</strong> isn’t supported everywhere, but <strong>proto</strong> gives you the gist.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is another way to create objects with a prototype chain that includes another object. It’s called the constructor function. In essence, you use the <code>new</code> as such:</p>

<p>~~~ var Student = function(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.greet = function() { console.log(“Hello ” + this.name + “, hope you are well”); }</p>

<p>greg = new Student(“Greg”, 29); greg.greet() == “Hello Greg, hope you are well”;</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>By using new, everything that had <code>this</code> before it becomes a member of the new object (<code>greg</code> in this case)</p>

<p>Now, there is actually a different way to effectively accomplish the same thing, but let’s move on to the next subtitle of this article, so that I can start making some of these my own thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="my_point">My point</h3>

<p>Have a look at these snippets:</p>

<p>~~~ var Student = function(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.greet = function() { console.log(“Hello ” + this.name + “, hope you are well”); }</p>

<p>~~~ and</p>

<p>~~~ var Student = function(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } Student.prototype.greet = function() { console.log(“Hello ” + this.name + “, hope you are well”);</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>For both of them, this still holds true:</p>

<p>~~~ var greg = new Student(“Greg”, 29); greg.greet() == “Hello Greg, hope you are well”;</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>So, here’s where you can learn what <code>prototype</code> is if you don’t already know. In the second snippet, I’m using the <code>prototype</code> property of constructor functions to effectively add the rest of the <code>this</code> statements (in this case, just <code>this.greet</code>). That’s pretty much all <code>prototype</code> does. It’s a place to put things that you want a constructor functions children (so to speak) to have when they are created. And I realize that “child” is a comvoluted term in computing, so humor me here.</p>

<p>Here’s where I’m give my opinion. <code>prototype</code> should <strong>always</strong> be used for non-configurable attributes. In the Student example, it’s handy to be able to pass (“Greg”, 29) to the function to configure the object (because name and age will change for every object), but the greet method doesn’t need any configuring. It’s always the same code for all of the objects that the Student constructor function will create. Therefore, I contend that greet should always be written with Student.prototype (as in the 2nd snippet) instead of this.greet (as in the 1st snippet). My reasons are 2:</p>

<ol>
<li>Code is easier to read
<ul>
<li>If you’re reading through a new JS file, and there is a constructor function, it’s easier to grasp what’s going on in the code if you have all of the configurable code in the actual constructor and then all member functions listed down below in .prototype.function_name calls.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>It prevents polluting the global namespace in the case that someone accidentally calls the constructor function without the <code>new</code> keyword.
<ul>
<li>If you were to call Student() directly, you would add age and name to the window object. This is a use-case that hopefully will never happen, but in the case that someone doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing (it happens), then at least <code>.greet</code> won’t get added to the global namespace as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>My point is simple, and it’s probably not even worth mentioning, but I try to be intentional when I code in every way, so I did my best to come up with a case for how to form constructor functions. Let me know what you think.</p>
