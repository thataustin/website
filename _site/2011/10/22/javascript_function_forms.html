<h1 id='javascript_function_forms'>Javascript function forms</h1>

<p>For a lot of my relatively inexperienced javascript life, I&#8217;ve had a lot of miconceptions about the different ways to create functions. This article is quite possible useless since there are so many good articles on the topic, but I&#8217;m going to blog about it anyway&#8230;possibly because I&#8217;m in dire need of a way to pass the time until my new pool cue arrives in the mail.</p>

<p>First off, I don&#8217;t remember where exactly I learned these things, so I&#8217;ll just give credit to <a href='http://www.crockford.com/'>Mr. Douglas Crockford</a>, the source of most all vanilla JS knowledge.</p>

<p>I used to think that the following two lines of code were exactly the same in javascript:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'>1</span> <span class='kd'>function</span> <span class='nx'>add</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>a</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nx'>b</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='cp'>{</span> <span class='na'>return</span> <span class='na'>a</span> <span class='o'>+</span> <span class='na'>b</span><span class='o'>;</span> <span class='cp'>}</span>
<span class='lineno'>2</span> <span class='nx'>add</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kd'>function</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>a</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nx'>b</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='cp'>{</span> <span class='na'>return</span> <span class='na'>a</span> <span class='o'>+</span> <span class='na'>b</span><span class='o'>;</span> <span class='cp'>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and while it&#8217;s typically true enough for the CJP (common-man javascript programmer), I realized a while later that it isn&#8217;t 100% accurate.</p>

<p>First, it is important to note that &#8220;function&#8221; is a native type in javascript. Just as &#8216;number&#8217; and &#8216;string&#8217; are types, so is &#8216;function&#8217;. Having said this, a function can have many properties. For example, a function object can have a name property and a length property. Let&#8217;s have look at an example:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'>1</span> <span class='kd'>function</span> <span class='nx'>say_hello</span><span class='p'>()</span> <span class='cp'>{</span> <span class='na'>alert</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span class='o'>);</span> <span class='cp'>}</span>
<span class='lineno'>2</span> 
<span class='lineno'>3</span> <span class='nx'>console</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>log</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>say_hello</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>name</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// logs &#39;say_hello&#39;</span>
<span class='lineno'>4</span> <span class='nx'>console</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>log</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>say_hello</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>length</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>//logs 0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So creating a function this way actually creates an attribute on the say_hello variable called &#8220;name&#8221; (sidenote: the length attribute is actually the number of arguments called for by the function signature). Now I&#8217;ll show you a difference between the two function forms:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'>1</span> <span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>say_hello</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kd'>function</span><span class='p'>()</span> <span class='cp'>{</span> <span class='na'>alert</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span class='o'>);</span> <span class='cp'>}</span>
<span class='lineno'>2</span> 
<span class='lineno'>3</span> <span class='nx'>console</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>log</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>say_hello</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>name</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>//logs &#39;anonymous&#39;</span>
<span class='lineno'>4</span> <span class='nx'>console</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>log</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>say_hello</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>length</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>//logs 0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Did you notice the function doesn&#8217;t have a name? That may not seem like a big deal, because you may think (as I often do) that say_hello(1, 2) functions the same in either case. And in this case it does.</p>

<p>But there are cases where naming a function one way over the other can actually cause you problems. What if you passed say_hello to a new scope? And what if say_hello, rather than being the simple function that is, had a recursive call inside of it? Let&#8217;s look at a very simple example that almost covers the case I just described:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'> 1</span>   <span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>countDownToZero</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kd'>function</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>number</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='cp'>{</span>
<span class='lineno'> 2</span>       <span class='na'>if</span> <span class='o'>(</span><span class='na'>number</span> <span class='o'>&lt;=</span> <span class='m'>0</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='na'>return</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;You made it to zero&quot;</span><span class='o'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'> 3</span>       <span class='na'>return</span> <span class='na'>countDownToZero</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='na'>number</span><span class='o'>-</span><span class='m'>1</span><span class='o'>);</span>
<span class='lineno'> 4</span>   <span class='cp'>}</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'> 5</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 6</span>   <span class='c1'>// ... some stuff happens in this terrible code ...</span>
<span class='lineno'> 7</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 8</span>   <span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>temp</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>countDownToZero</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'> 9</span>   <span class='nx'>countDownToZero</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kc'>undefined</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'>10</span> 
<span class='lineno'>11</span>   <span class='c1'>// ... the function we care about ended up in a var called temp instead of a var with a rational name</span>
<span class='lineno'>12</span>   <span class='nx'>console</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>log</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>temp</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>20</span><span class='p'>));</span> <span class='c1'>// TypeError: undefined is not a function</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So, this a totally contrived example, but since you&#8217;re reading this, keep going just a little further:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'> 1</span>   <span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>countDownToZero</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kd'>function</span> <span class='nx'>localName</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>number</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='cp'>{</span>
<span class='lineno'> 2</span>       <span class='na'>if</span> <span class='o'>(</span><span class='na'>number</span> <span class='o'>&lt;=</span> <span class='m'>0</span><span class='o'>)</span> <span class='na'>return</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;You made it to zero&quot;</span><span class='o'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'> 3</span>       <span class='na'>return</span> <span class='na'>localName</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='na'>number</span><span class='o'>-</span><span class='m'>1</span><span class='o'>);</span>
<span class='lineno'> 4</span>   <span class='cp'>}</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'> 5</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 6</span>   <span class='c1'>// ... again, some stuff happens in this terrible code ...</span>
<span class='lineno'> 7</span> 
<span class='lineno'> 8</span>   <span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>temp</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>countDownToZero</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'> 9</span>   <span class='nx'>countDownToZero</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='kc'>undefined</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='lineno'>10</span> 
<span class='lineno'>11</span>   <span class='c1'>// ... and again, the function we care about ended up in a var called temp instead of a var with a rational name</span>
<span class='lineno'>12</span>   <span class='nx'>console</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>log</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>temp</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>20</span><span class='p'>));</span> <span class='c1'>// &quot;You made it to zero&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, you can see how combining the two methods gives you something interesting. By naming the function itself, you have access to the function inside the function&#8217;s scope. This is very useful if you are going to pass the function outside of it&#8217;s original scope and still want to call it recursively.</p>

<p>So, all that to say, naming functions through assignment is different from naming them after the function keyword.</p>

<p>For completeness sake, I want to should probably mention the other forms of creating the function object. First, there is the formal Function object. You should probably never use this, but here&#8217;s an example anyway:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'>1</span> <span class='kd'>var</span> <span class='nx'>say_hello</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nb'>Function</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;string1′, &#39;</span><span class='nx'>string2</span><span class='err'>′</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;alert(&quot;Hello, I noticed you said: &quot; + string1 + string2);&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='lineno'>2</span> <span class='nx'>say_hello</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;taco &#39;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;sauce&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// alerts &#39;Hello, I noticed you said: taco sauce&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, there is the single-execution function, or as I like to call it, the “Fire in the hole!” function. To note, I&#8217;ve never called it that out-loud.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='js+smarty'><span class='lineno'>1</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='kd'>function</span> <span class='p'>()</span><span class='cp'>{</span> <span class='na'>alert</span><span class='o'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span class='o'>);</span> <span class='cp'>}</span><span class='p'>)();</span> <span class='c1'>// alerts &#39;hello&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The cool thing about that form is that you create, run and basically destroy that function all at once. You don&#8217;t have to worry about naming it poorly, because you don&#8217;t name it. Not much good for recursion, but that&#8217;s like saying it&#8217;s not much good for recursion – go back to the beginning of this sentence if that didn&#8217;t make sense.</p>

<p>Okay, so we have our 4 different ways of declaring functions. I hope you&#8217;ve learned something about how to create a function in javascript. Now, if you want to know how to create a useful function, you should learn about “this”. The word “this” is a tricky, tricky thing in javascript, and not something you want to screw up.</p>
